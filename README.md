# AbstractInterface
a Solidity smart contract that implements both an abstract contract and an interface:
# Explanation:

MyAbstractContract is an abstract contract that defines a function called abstractFunction. Abstract contracts cannot be deployed on their own; they are meant to be inherited by other contracts that implement their abstract functions.
MyInterface is an interface that defines a function called interfaceFunction. Interfaces cannot contain any implementations; they only declare the functions that implementing contracts must define.
MyContract is a concrete contract that implements both the abstract contract and the interface. It provides implementations for the abstract function and the function declared in the interface.
The abstractFunction function in MyContract implements the abstract function from MyAbstractContract by storing the provided value in the storedValue state variable.
The interfaceFunction function in MyContract implements the function declared in MyInterface. In this example, it stores twice the provided value in the storedValue state variable.
